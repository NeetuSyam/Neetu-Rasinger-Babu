<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I am actively pursuing a master's degree in Data Analytics at San Jose State University. I have around two years of experience as a Software Engineer at Light Pharma Private Limited. I am passionate about Big Data, Analytics and Machine Learning. I have a thorough understanding of Big Data, Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, Statistics, and Machine Learning. Furthermore I have completed various realted to data in Udemy, Coursera, DataCamp, LinkedIn Learning to gain a strong theoretical foundation. Later I began to work on varoius projects to obtain practical experience.

I am currently working on Real time American Sign Language to Speech Conversion System, which is a computer vision and NLP related project. To enhance the functionality the sign language is converted to text and to  speech. OpenPose/OpenCV was utilized in this research to extract the key sign language points, and CNN, Transformers, and AWS Polly were used to translate the extracted features into text and speech.
